        Thanks for taking the time to fill out this issue report.

        Before creating the issue, follow these steps:

        1. If it is more of a question than a problem, consider opening a [Discussion](https://github.com/rg35xx-cfw/Koriki/discussions) post instead of opening an Issue.
        2. Think about whether the issue is with the distribution itself or with one of the pieces of software it contains (SimpleMenu, RetroArch, Apps).
        3. The software contained in the distribution is mostly homebrew and not perfect. Consider whether your request makes sense considering the situation.
        4. The distribution brings together the work of many people who have put in many hours of effort. If you encounter an issue that you have the capacity to solve on your own, consider taking some time to contribute with the solution to the collective work.
